# Khalsa Tech

## Mission

This nonprofit's mission is to upgrade the tech infrastructure used by places of worship by automating manual procedures.

## Values

- Build software for love and not for money

## Projects

### SukhBook

A mobile app for the local Sikh Communities in Southern Ontario that automates the out-of-date manual event booking procedures to save unpaid part-time Gurdwara Committee volunteers precious time. I'm hoping to push this project all across North America!
